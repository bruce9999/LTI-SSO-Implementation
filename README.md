# LTI-SSO-Implementation
This is an implementation of LTI SSO using OAuth 

This code was written for Codeigniter, but will work similarly in other frameworks or straight PHP.

The file login.php is the controller and lti_login_model.php is the model.

This example uses OAuth libraries from Google:

 oauth/OAuthRequestVerifier
 oauth/OAuthRequest
